Description: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 This package is missing three fonts from the X.Org source archives
 because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,
 and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Luxi.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
